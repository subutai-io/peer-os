   Uncomment the following to compile the widgetset for one browser only.
   This can reduce the GWT compilation time significantly when debugging.
   The line should be commented out before deployment to production
   environments.

   Multiple browsers can be specified for GWT 1.7 as a comma separated
   list. The supported user agents at the moment of writing were:
   ie6,ie8,gecko,gecko1_8,safari,opera

   The value gecko1_8 is used for Firefox 3 and later and safari is used for
   webkit based browsers including Google Chrome.
